copied from https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/languages.toml to my languages.toml file in ~/.config/helix

ran `hx --grammar fetch` and then `hx --grammar build`

(for me hx --grammar build failed as I needed xcrun https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/711512)

installed `xcrun` from the command line: `> xcode-select --install`

installed zls from https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/How-to-install-the-default-language-servers

```
git clone https://github.com/zigtools/zls
cd zls
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe # <-- this failed for me, so I dropped the `-Doptimize=ReleaseSafe` piece
```

next I added `zls` to PATH in .zshrc: 
`export PATH=$PATH:~/Dev/Libs/zls`
